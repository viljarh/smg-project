### Team Member :

    Viljar Hoem-Olsen
    Gaute Øye
    Eirik Imrik
    Thomas Åkre

### Sprint 1

    Date : --> 1. November 2024

    Plan :
    - Start discussing the project with the team
    - Let everyone get a overview of the project
    - Start Implement the TCP protocol in the client and server

    What have been done :
    - Started implemented the TCP protocol in the client and server

    Until next sprint :
    - Continue implementing the TCP protocol in the client and server

    We have tried to work seperatly on each problem to try to solve it, and then meet up to discuss the problems we have encountered.
    We chose this approach because Gaute and Thomas are on exchange in Spain, and Viljar and Eirik are in Norway. We have different time schedule all
    so we trying to find time that will work for everyone, and try to update each other if we have solved a problem or if there is something we´re stuck on.

### Sprint 2

    Dato : 1. November 2024 - 18. November

    Plan :
    - Fully implement the TCP protocol in the client and server
    - Start sending message through the TCP protocol

    Approach :
    - Viljar har implemented the tcp client and server.
    - Gaute has initialized the TCP protocol in the client and server so that it can send and receive messages.

    Until next sprint :
    Update GUI and implement the check boxes so it send information to actuators.
    Update acutautors states between server and controlpanel nodes.

    Write in protocol.md file, to answer the question when each have time.

### Sprint 3

    Dato : 18. November - 25. November
    Plan :
    - Update GUI and implement the check boxes so it send information to actuators.
    - Update acutautors states between server and controlpanel nodes.
    - Write in protocol.md file, to answer the question when each have time.

    - Start to prepere for the presentation. 

    What have been done:
    - Gaute Updated the GUI and implemented the check boxes so it send information to actuators.
    so now we can check off a box in a controlpanel, and it will respons in the node gui, and vise versa.


    Approach:
    - We tried seperatly to work on the GUI to implement the checkboxes, and then we met
    up to discuss where we found a solution to how to implement it. 

    Until next sprint:
    - Implement extra features to the project where we feel like can improve the prjoject.
    - Fix so the server stop when exiting greenhouse application window. 
    - Chech over the code to see if there is anything missing.

    

### Sprint 4

    Dato : 25. November - 2. December

    Plan : 
    - Implement SSL
    - Finish the project
    - Make the video for the presentation

    Approach:
    - We finished the project, where Eirik implemented SSL, so the communication between the nodes is secure.
    - Thomas made the video for the presentation.
    - Viljar has made the javadoc more clear and readable

    Retrospective : 
    - We think that we have done a good job about the project, where we also have added som extra features to the project.
    We have communicated good in the group, where we have tried to help and discuss the problems we have encounted.
    We had the most problem to understand how everything worked together, but when we sat down together we found it easier to understand what each component did, and let everyone have the same understanding of what we were going to do.

    What we though were a good solution, where to use live-coding, so everyone could see what was happening, and we could discuss it together. Gaute and Viljar had a good understanding of the project, where they had the most control of the programming, where Eirik and Thomas helped discussed the problems and helped with possible solutions.
